      <p class="intro">I have been shooting professionally for almost 2 years and my work has taken me all over the world.<br>
      I have met so many incredible humans because of this career and I still cannot believe my art allows me.<br>
      One of the best compliments I get from clients is that they feel like they've known me forever after a session.<br>
      I love creating authentic, candid moments that capture more than just a memory but tell a story for you and your
      loved ones to cherish forever..</p>
